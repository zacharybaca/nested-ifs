"""Task 1: Code Correction

You are provided with a Python script that is supposed to guide a user through an adventure game, but it has some errors. Identify and fix them."""

"""Task 2: Setting the Scene

Based on the corrected code from Task 1, expand the game. If the user chooses "cave", ask them if they want to "light a torch" or "proceed in the dark", and provide outcomes for each decision."""


"""Task 3: Default Path

If the user makes an invalid choice at any point, use the pass statement for now. Later, you can enhance this to provide feedback or a different branch of the story."""
